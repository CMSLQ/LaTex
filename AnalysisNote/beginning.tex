  \begin{abstract}
    The discovery potential for pair production of first generation scalar leptoquarks that 
    decay to an electron and quark is investigated 
    at the CMS experiment using Monte Carlo samples produced with a full simulation of detector response.  
    The analysis strategy assumes an integrated luminosity of 100 pb$^{-1}$ and $pp$ collisions 
    at $\sqrt{s}=10$ TeV.
    Reconstruction and identification of high energy electrons and jets, 
    and optimized selection of events are discussed.
    The electron-jet invariant mass distribution is reconstructed
    and used to identify the possible presence of a leptoquark signal.
    Data-driven techiques are discussed to determine the main standard model backgrounds through use of 
    control samples. The CMS discovery and exclusion potentials using a counting experiment approach 
    are quantified for different leptoquark mass hyphotheses.

%The leptoquarks are assumed to decay exclusively to electrons and quarks.  Detailed explanations of the discovery techniques and data driven methods to extract the signal from background events are given.  
%Both exclusion limits and discovery potential are discussed for masses of the leptoquark ranging from around the current limit of 251 GeV to 1 TeV.

\section{Introduction}

This note describes the analysis techniques that will be used to search for evidence of 
first generation scalar leptoquarks 
at the CMS experiment. 
The methods described are evaluated using Monte Carlo (MC) simulations assuming a start-up scenario of LHC
with about 100 pb$^{-1}$ of integrated luminosity and 5 TeV proton beams.

Leptoquarks (LQ) are new exotic particles conjectured to have both baryon and lepton number 
and primary decays into leptons and quarks. 
Several models of physics beyond the standard model (SM) predict the existence of leptoquarks,
including General Unified Theories, technicolor and composite models \cite{theories}.  
%% OTHER MODELS (SUSY WITH R-PARITY???)

Leptoquarks carry color and fractional electric charge, 
and can be either scalar or vector particles. The three generations of predicted leptoquarks 
correspond to the families of quarks and leptons in the SM.  Intergenerational coupling of 
leptoquarks is highly constrained by the experimental limits on flavor-changing neutral currents. 
%FIXME% \cite{ADDREFERENCE}. 

The parameters of the model are i) $M_{LQ}$, the LQ mass, ii) $\beta$, the branching fraction for the decay 
$\mbox{LQ} \rightarrow l + q$, where $l$ is a charged lepton and $q$ is a quark, and
iii) $\lambda_{\mbox{LQ}lq}$, the coupling between LQ, lepton and quark ($\mbox{LQ}-l-q$ vertex). 
The complementary decay of a branching ratio 1-$\beta$ describes the decay $\mbox{LQ} \rightarrow \nu + q$, 
where $\nu$ is a weak-isospin partner of the lepton.
Results from HERA on upper limits for LQ production restrict  
$\lambda_{\mbox{LQ}lq}$ to relatively weak coupling\cite{hera}. For example, fixing the paramameter 
$\lambda_{\mbox{LQ}lq} = \lambda_{EM} \approx 0.3$, leads to 
a theoretical relative width for the LQ of ($\Gamma_{LQ}/M_{LQ}$) around 0.2\%. 
Consequently, $\Gamma_{LQ}/M_{LQ}$ will not be able to be measured at the LHC, since 
the width of any peak on the mass distribution of the LQ will be dominated by detector resolution.  

Experiments at the Tevatron have placed the most stringent lower limit on the mass of first-generation scalar 
leptoquarks of approximately 290 GeV (assuming $\beta=1$ for the electron channel) \cite{d02008},\cite{cdf2005}.
At the LHC, the pair production of leptoquarks will take place mainly through gluon-gluon fusion and 
quark-antiquark annihilation, yielding $LQ + \overline{LQ}$. 
The cross sections for the two sub-processes are almost independent on the value of 
$\lambda_{\mbox{LQ}lq}$, since there is no $\mbox{LQ}-l-q$ vertex in the Feynman diagram for LQ pair production 
at leading order. At lower rate, the production of single leptoquark in association with a lepton is also possible via quark-gluon 
fusion, yielding $LQ+ l$ or $LQ+ \nu$ (and relative final states with antiparticles). The cross section of single leptoquark production
becomes comparable to the one of pair production only for $M_{LQ}\approx 1$ TeV \cite{LQSingleAndPairProd}, 
which is well above the experimental reach of this start-up analysis (focused on the first 100 pb$^{-1}$ of data at $\sqrt{s}=10$ TeV).  
This note examines the signal for pair production of first-generation scalar leptoquarks that decay into electrons and 
(light) quarks with a branching ratio $\beta=1$. 
For this scenario, the experimental signature of a LQ event is quite striking with two 
high transverse momentum ($p_T$) electrons and two high $p_T$ jets (eejj channel), 
whose combination yields a peak in the electron-jet invariant mass 
spectrum that corresponds to the LQ mass. No true missing transverse momentum is expected in LQ events.

This note is organized as follows. 
The signal and background MC samples used in this study are described in Section \ref{sec:MCSamples}.
The online requirements and the trigger efficiency for selecting LQ events are discussed in Section \ref{sec:trig}.
The LQ signal is reconstructed using mainly energy measurements from the
electromagnetic (ECAL) and hadronic (HCAL) calorimeters, while tracker information 
is used primarily to identify and select electrons. 
The reconstruction and identification of high energy electrons and jets are described, respectively, 
in Sections \ref{sec:electrons} and \ref{sec:jet}.
Techniques used to identify the LQ signal include optimization of selection criteria based on 
reconstructed quantities to discriminate between signal and background, 
and data-driven techniques to estimate the dominant background processes.
In Section \ref{sec:eventSelection}, the analysis strategy, the optimization of the selection criteria, 
and the relative selection efficiencies are discussed. 
Data-driven techniques for estimating background are presented in Section \ref{sec:bkgStudy}.
Finally, the estimate of the main systematic uncertainties, and the CMS discovery/exclusion potential 
in the eejj channel are described, respectively, in Section \ref{sec:Systematics} and \ref{CMSpotential}.


%Experiments at the Tevatron have placed the current lower mass limit of the first generation scalar leptoquark at 251 GeV (assuming a branching ratio of 1 into electrons) \cite{d02007}.  This study includes 
%signal samples produced at a range of masses from 250 GeV to 1 TeV.  Monte Carlo simulation studies show the reach of CMS to be leptoquarks of masses around 1 TeV.  Assuming a mass of the leptoquark at the 
%current limit the studies show a $5 \sigma$ discovery possibility with just above $5pb^{-1}$ of integrated luminosity.  With the full statistics used in this study of  $100pb^{-1}$  a leptoquark of mass close 
%to 500 GeV could be discovered with a significance of $5 \sigma$.
