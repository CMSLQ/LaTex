\section{Event Selection} \label{sec:eventSelection}

The basic strategy to identify the existence of a particle that decays to a jet and an electron 
is to study the invariant mass of the electron-jet pairs in the events. 
The signal of a leptoquark would appear as a bump in the distribution of this invariant mass.
The decay of a particle to a jet and a lepton is forbidden in the standard model.  
Thus, a peak at the mass of the leptoquark would be the only resonance in this distribution. 
The electron-jet combinations of the background events have a different shape than that 
of the leptoquark resonance. 
Nonetheless, the number of background events could dominate over the number of signal events.  
The cut-based selection described in this section has been made in order to minimize the number 
of background events selected while retaining a high signal efficiency.

The decay of a leptoquark and an anti-leptoquark produces two high energy electrons and 
two high energy jets.
The online selection of candidate events is made by either the HLT trigger ``HLT\_Photon15\_L1R'' 
or ``HLT\_Photon25\_L1R'' described in section~\ref{sec:trig}, depending on the luminosity scenario, 
while the offline identification of electrons and jets 
proceeds as described in sections~\ref{sec:electrons} and \ref{sec:jet}, respectively.

%FIXME add skim
In order to reduce the size of the of the data samples and the time to analyze them, a skim of the 
data has been defined.
The requirements that the skim has to satisfy have been defined considering that this skim may be needed
for the analysis of both first and second generation leptoquark pair production. Such requirements are:
\begin{itemize}
\item having a high efficiency for first (events with 2 electrons and 2 jets) and second (events with 
2 muons and 2 jets) generation leptoquark pair production; 
\item keeping events needed for the control samples: the control sample for the Z+jets background is $Z\rightarrow l l$+ 2 jets,
where $l$ is is either an electron or a muon; the control sample for the the $t\bar{t}$+jets background is a sample 
with an electron, a muon and 2 jets;
\item suppressing all other backgrounds
\end{itemize}
The cuts that define the skim have been chosen as:
\begin{itemize}
\item $N_l \equiv N_e + N_{\mu} \ge 2$, where $N_e (N_{\mu})$ is the number of reconstructed electrons (muons)
with $P_T>20~$GeV and without ID or isolation requirements applied; this cut suppresses events with low 
lepton multiplicity and low lepton $P_T$, such as QCD, W+jets and $t\bar{t}$ fully hadronic decays;
\item $N_{\mathrm{obj}} \ge 4$, where $N_{\mathrm{obj}} \equiv N_l + N_{\mathrm{jet}}$; $N_l$ is defined as above, and
$N_{\mathrm{jet}}$ is the number of the jets with a raw (i.e. without jet energy corrections) $P_T > 10~$GeV and without 
any electron with $P_T > 20~$GeV within a cone of $\Delta R=0.1$; this cut suppresses $Z \rightarrow ll$ and 
$Z \rightarrow ll$+~1~jet while preserving $Z \rightarrow ll$+~2~(or more)~jets.
\end{itemize}

The offline selection of the eejj sample continues with the following kinematical cuts:
%
\begin{enumerate}
\item at least 2 isolated electrons, both of them required $P_T>30$~GeV 
\item at least 2 jets, both of them required to have $P_T>50$~GeV
\item $M_{ee}>100$~GeV
\item $S_T\equiv P_T(e_1)+P_T(e_2)+P_T(j_1)+P_T(j_2)>f(M_{LQ})$, where $f(M_{LQ})$ is a function 
of the hypothesized LQ mass.
\end{enumerate}
%

The specific values of the kinematical cuts has been determined using a cut-optimization procedure meant to
reach the maximum potential of the analysis for excluding the existence of a LQ signal. 
Such a procedure is described in section~\ref{sec:optimization}.

Cut 1 and 2 set a minimum value on the transverse momentum of electrons and jets. 
The 2 leading electrons and 2 leading jets are used to continue the selection.
Cut 3, where $M_{ee}$ is the invariant mass of the electron pair, removes background events from 
$Z/\gamma$+jets events as shown in figure~\ref{fig:Mee_St_distributions}-left.
Cut 4, where the variable $S_T$ is defined as the scalar sum of the transverse momenta of the 
2 electrons and 2 jets, is applied following the approach of the experiment $D0$ in 
\cite{Abazov:2001mx}. In that paper, an event selection optimization as a function of
the combinations of several kinematic variables has shown that $S_T$ is the most powerful one 
and little is gained by adding cuts on other variables. The distribution of $S_T$ for the present
analysis is shown in figure~\ref{fig:Mee_St_distributions}-right.

Once the eejj sample is selected, there are two ways to combine two electrons and two jets to make two electron-jet pairs. 
For each event, the combination with the minimum difference, $\Delta M_{ej}$, between the invariant masses, $M_{ej}$, 
of the two electron-jet pairs is chosen\footnote{
A study at MC generator level has been performed to investigate the effect of jets generated by initial state 
radiation (ISR). The probability that an ISR jet has actually a larger $P_T$ than one or both jets produced 
by the decay of the leptoquarks is 25\% and 12\% at LQ mass of 250~GeV, and 20\% and 8\% at LQ mass of 400~GeV. 
In such percentage of events, choosing the 2 leading jets as doughters of the leptoquarks is not correct. 
If the third leading jet were considered, the number of combinations to make 2 electron-jet pairs would become six.
The same algorithm used above and based on the minimum difference $\Delta M_{ej}$ could be applied to select one 
among the six combinations. Our study showed that the improvement in finding the correct combination would be at the level
of the percent with respect to the case where only the two leading jets are considered.
Using $\Delta M_{ej}$ divided by the average of the two $M_{ej}$ as discriminator quantity instead of $\Delta M_{ej}$
would bring a further, but even minor improvement.
Given the moderate improvement coming from using the third leading jet and considerations of simplicity and robustness
of the analysis, the current version of the analysis uses only the two leading jets.
}. 
The resulting $M_{ej}$ distribution is shown in figure~\ref{fig:Mej_allComb} for the signal and backgrounds.

\label{tab:effic-W}
\end{table}



A summary of the number of selected signal and background events expected in 100 pb$^{-1}$ of data 
is reported in Table \ref{tab:EventSelSummary}. 
The overall signal selection efficiencies are around 30-50\% for the LQ masses investigated. 
After the described event selection, the dominant background contributions 
are $t\bar{t}$ and $Z/\gamma$+jets. Data-driven techniques to estimate these backgrounds
are discussed in section~\ref{sec:bkgStudy}.

\caption{\small \sl Number events expected from LQ signal and background samples after the analysis selection for 100 pb$^{-1}$ of data.
The value cut on the kinematic variable $S_T$ depends on the LQ mass, and it is indicated in the second column.
Data samples from FullSim Monte Carlo are used for all backgrounds and for LQ massed of 250 and 400 GeV. Signal samples marked by (*) are
made with the FastSim Monte Carlo.
The LQ cross section rapidly falls at high LQ mass, thus producing a relative decrease in the number of selected events. }
