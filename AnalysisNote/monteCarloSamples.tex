\section{Monte Carlo Samples} \label{sec:MCSamples}

%By far the dominant process is that of gluon-gluon 
%fusion, as can been seen in table~\ref{tab:CTEQ6} where the leading order and next to leading order cross sections are shown, 
%as well as the ratio of the processes contributing to the total cross section.  
%A more detailed description of the calculations of these numbers can be found in ~\cite{Kramer}.

MC signal samples are generated with leptoquark masses ranging from 250 GeV to 1 TeV and $\beta=1$. 
At the LHC, the three main processes that lead to leptoquark pair production are gluon-gluon fusion, 
quark-antiquark annihilation, and the higher order process of quark-gluon fusion. In the mass range to be investigated gluon-gluon fusion dominates. 

The "Full Simulation" (FullSim) signal samples are produced using 
CMSSW\_2\_1\_6 (PYTHIA version 6.227 and GEANT 4) 
These samples were included in the official "Summer 08" production by the CMS Generators group.
These signal events were generated for 100 $\mbox{pb}^{-1}$ samples with the accepted mis-calibration and alignment 
of the detectors. Table~1
%\ref{tab:NumEvents} 
shows the number of events and the cross sections at leading order (LO) for samples generated at different LQ mass.

%Additionally, samples produced with the Fast Simulation (FastSim) in CMSSW version 1\_6\_9 are 
%studied in order to validate the quality of the FastSim process. The FastSim uses a parameterization 
%of the detector response instead of using the full GEANT-based simulation to determine the detector response.
%The FastSim samples are created with the same mis-calibration and mis-alignment scheme as the FullSim samples. 
%%Table ~\ref{tab:FastVsFullSim} shows the relative time and size advantage of using the FastSim over the FullSim for leptoquark event production.  
%The use of the FastSim would be highly beneficial to this analysis, as the production of events with such large EM showers, and large numbers of particles generated 
%are quite time consuming in the FullSim.  
%%The comparison of the MC events generated with FullSim to the FastSim shows an agreement at few \% level in 
%%the shape of reconstructed quantities, and some discrepancies around 5-10\% in the reconstruction efficiencies. 
%Plots comparing various reconstructed quantities are included in some sub-sections of this note.  
%The main results of this analysis, including selection efficiencies and discovery potential are obtained with FullSim samples.

The SM background is taken from the Summer08 official production samples,
which consists of more than 150M events of various SM processes roughly representing the first 100 pb$^{-1}$ of LHC data.
All events are generated and simulated with CMSSW\_2\_1\_6. 
The Summer08 samples used for this analysis are listed below:
\begin{itemize}
%
\item $t\bar{t}$+jet events (for N<5), generated using MADGRAPH \cite{Mangano:2002ea} with a 
LO-NLO K correction factor of 1.85 applied 
to the LQ cross section;\footnote{The K factor of 1.85 applied to ttbar events is a default in the software provided by CMS for 
 these data samples.  It is from a MCFM NLO vs LO study.}
%
\item $Z/\gamma*$+jet events (for N<6), generated using MADGRAPH
;  
%
\item $W$+Njet events (for N<6), generated using MADGRAPH, $ 0 < P_{T}^{W} < 300 $ GeV, $W$ decaying into leptons;  
%
\item QCD multi-jet events, generated with PYTHIA, inclusive production in $P_{T}^{jet}$ bins from 0 to $\infty$;  
%
\item $\gamma$+jet events, generated with PYTHIA, $ 0 < P_{T}^{jet} < 7000 $ GeV;  
%
\item $WW$, $WZ$, $ZZ$ events, generated with PYTHIA, inclusive production (all decays).
\end{itemize} 

%In the CSA07 production there were three flavors of Standard Model event combinations, two of which were used in this analysis: 
%the {\sl Chowder} contains ALPGEN W+jet, Z+jet and tt+jet samples, and the {\sl Gumbo} which contains QCD, Photon+jets, MinBias.  
%The event samples for each process within the soups were produced with numbers of events corresponding to a variety of integrated luminosities. 
%In order to scale the sample sizes correctly a central module that calculates the event weights has been used ({\sl CSA07EventWeightProducer.cc}) .
